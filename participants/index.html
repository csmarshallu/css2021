    <h2>Information for Presenters</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Presenters will be asked to submit Narrated PowerPoint Presentation Slides to Dr. Cong Pu via <a href = "mailto: cs.marshallu@gmail.com">cs.marshallu@gmail.com</a>.</b>

        <b>If the file is too large to send, please submit the download link to Dr. Cong Pu via <a href = "mailto: cs.marshallu@gmail.com">cs.marshallu@gmail.com</a>.</b>

        <br>

        For the virtual symposium format, presenters are encouraged to think creatively about how to record and disseminate their research and scholarly endeavors as long as the minimum number of required media files are submitted. 
        
        <br>
        <br>

        For detailed instructions and resources on how to upload your presentation, please read the following information carefully.

        <br>
        <br>

        All presentations will be categorized in the VoiceThread cloud application. 
        In order to share their presentations, presenters will be required to register for a VoiceThread account. 
        If you don&rsquo;t already have an account, please set one up here: <a href="https://voicethread.com/register/">https://voicethread.com/register/</a>

        <b style="font-size:25px">Recording Your Presentation</b>

        <br>
        <br>

        We strongly encourage presenters to combine audio and visual elements for the recording of their presentation to assist audience members during their viewing experience. 
        The best method to combine audio and visual elements is to add audio to presentation within PowerPoint and export the presentation as a video file. 
        <!--This video file may be directly uploaded to VoiceThread or to YouTube to generate a URL.-->

        <br>
        <br>

        For Microsoft's instructions on how to record audio on your presentation within PowerPoint, <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/record-a-presentation-2570dff5-f81c-40bc-b404-e04e95ffab33?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us">please click here.</a>

        <br>
        <br>

        <!--
        Stand-alone audio recordings can be considered if video capturing (via a laptop, camera, or smartphone) or software (e.g., Zoom) recording is not technically feasible.

        <!--
        <b style="font-size:25px">Recording Options</b>

        <br>
        <br>

        We understand presenters may be experiencing very different circumstances at this time. 
        Please consider the recording options below and reach out to <a href = "mailto: cs.marshallu@gmail.com">cs.marshallu@gmail.com</a> if you have any questions.

        <br>
        <br>

        Presenters may use any device with the capacity to capture audio or visual input as long as it is compatible with a file format accepted by VoiceThread (<a href="https://voicethread.com/howto/file-types-accepted/#audio">compatible audio and video files</a>). 
        A few examples of methods presenters might want to use to record their presentations are listed below:

        <br>

        <b>1.</b> Record audio and video of yourself giving your presentation (in front of a poster, PowerPoint, or your artwork) and upload the video to VoiceThread. 
                  You may also upload your video to YouTube, save it as an unlisted video, and submit the URL for this video to VoiceThread.
        <br>

        <b>2.</b>  Record an audio of your presentation within PowerPoint if video capturing is difficult to access. Oral presenters can do this with slideshows or poster presenters can do this on a single slide if their poster was designed in PowerPoint. 
                  For step-by-step instructions on how to record audio on a PowerPoint presentation, visit <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/record-a-presentation-2570dff5-f81c-40bc-b404-e04e95ffab33?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us">Microsoft's website here.</a>  
                  Instructions on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=219&v=D8JV3w4TOVw&feature=youtu.be">exporting to video files can be found here.</a>
        <br>

        <b>3.</b>  Record audio of yourself reading a paper if this convention applies to your field.

        <br>
        <br>

        <b style="font-size:25px">Submit Your Presentation</b>

        <br>
        <br>

        <b>Presenters will be asked to submit Narrated PowerPoint Presentation Slides to Dr. Cong Pu via <a href = "mailto: cs.marshallu@gmail.com">cs.marshallu@gmail.com</a>.</b> 

        <br>

        <!--
        The Virtual CSS uses a platform called VoiceThread, which enables presenters to upload all required presentation materials. 
        To access this platform, presenters must use either Chrome or Firefox. 
        Once presenters are in one of these two browsers, presenters can access VoiceThread by doing the following:

        <br>

        <b>1.</b> If you have never used VoiceThread before, please create a free account here: <a href="https://voicethread.com/register/">https://voicethread.com/register/</a> 

        <br>

        <b>2.</b> Once your account is created, click Sign In to enter your account information and access the Summer Symposium VoiceThread homepage here: <a href="#">TBA</a>

        <br>

        <b>3.</b> In the upper right corner, click on "Add your own" next to the green plus sign and then "Create a New VoiceThread."

        <br>

        <b>4.</b> Under +Add Media or drop files here, upload the Minimum Required Files as specified above for your specific category. 
        (Note: If your video size is too large for VoiceThread upload directly from your computer, you might try to upload your video to a different site and then link it to VoiceThread. 
        For instance, you might consider uploading it to YouTube and then following these instructions: <a href="https://voicethread.com/howto/media-from-another-website/">https://voicethread.com/howto/media-from-another-website/</a>)

        <br>

        <b>5.</b> In the space labeled Title, please follow the format "Last Name_Category_Presentation Number" and click Submit.

        <br>

        <b>6.</b> Afterward and as specified below, enable "Closed Captioning" on files containing audio and "Adjust Viewing Privileges".

        <br>

        <b>7.</b> Return from 9:00-10:30 am on April 25, 2021 to participate in "synchronous commenting" in real-time. 
        Visit frequently to respond to comments and questions posted on your VoiceThread presentation.

        <b style="font-size:25px">Closed Captioning</b>

        <br>
        <br>

        All recorded presentations and performances submitted to VoiceThread are required to have closed captioning enabled. Once your recording is added to your VoiceThread, follow the steps below to enable this feature:

        <br>

        <b>1.</b> Open your VoiceThread to view your recording.

        <br>

        <b>2.</b> Click on the closed captioning logo (CC) in the upper right-hand corner of the display window.

        <br>

        <b>3.</b> Click on the third option "Add Captions..."

        <br>

        <b>4.</b> Change the machine captions language to English and click on the green "Order" button. Once the throbber (i.e., spinning wheel) appears, you can close the window and navigate to a new page.

        <br>

        <b>5.</b> You will be emailed as soon as your request is processed and your recording with closed captioning can be viewed. There is an anticipated 4-day turnaround time.

        <br>

        <b>6.</b> To edit your captions, re-enter your VoiceThread and again click on the closed captioning logo (CC) in the upper right-hand corner of the display window. The CC display window will pop up. Click on "Edit Captions" at the bottom of the window. 

        <br>

        <b>7.</b> Edit and save your captions in the corresponding caption editor.

        <br>
        <br>

        Once you have completed your VoiceThread, you need to adjust your viewing privileges. Please follow the instructions below so that we can add your presentation to the symposium website: 

        <br>

        <b>1.</b> On your VoiceThread homepage, click the arrow that indicates you would like to share a link of your presentation.

        <br>

        <b>2.</b> Click on the "Who has access" tab and change the publishing option to "Anyone can comment."
